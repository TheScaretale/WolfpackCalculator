A project I created for my friends and the community of [Wolfpack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/Wolfpack/) to get better target solutions ingame, it's also a tool I used to learn JavaScript and some debugging.

This tool was shared on the game's discord channel so new people can also use it.
